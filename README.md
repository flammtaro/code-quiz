# code-quiz

## Description
- The goal of this project was to create a multiple choice quiz that uses buttons for its answer selection, has a countdown timer which will react negatively to wrong answers, and ultimately store the final results

- I built this project in order to better understand how to implement structured containers full of multiple attributes that can then be referenced and distributed when called. This was also one of the first big javascript projects for this curriculum

- What I learned on this project is that having an organized plan for your container structure and storage structure is vital to not losing track of where you are headed in your code

## Installation
To install this project, you need to:
-Download the code from the projects GitHub: https://github.com/flammtaro/code-quiz
-Open the code in Visual Studio Code

## Usage
This code contains the HTML and CSS of the current version of my portfolio website. An image of the current version of the website can be seen here: !![code quiz image](https://i.imgur.com/mMe1sVr.png). The program itself can be used to come up with different password variations for use in any account creation program.
